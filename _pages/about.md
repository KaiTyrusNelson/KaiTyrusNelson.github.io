Hello, I am Kai Nelson and I am an incoming PhD at [UC Berkeley (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), starting Fall 2025.

Previously, I was an undergraduate at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/), where I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* in Computer Science (AI Specialization) and was advised by [Padhraic Smyth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/) and [Stephan Mandt](https://www.stephanmandt.com/).

I also worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under [Dr. Mateusz Monterial](https://www.monterial.com/).

## Research Interests

I am interested in generative AI (flows and diffusion), reinforcement learning, and applications to physical science. 

In other studies, I am working on real analysis and measure-theoretic probability!
